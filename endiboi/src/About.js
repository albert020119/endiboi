      Hi, I'm Endre. I'm a security researcher at Bitdefender with a strong passion for uncovering the unknown and solving complex problems. My work revolves around reverse engineering, where I thrive at dissecting software to understand its inner workings. But my skills don't stop there â€” I'm versatile and take pride in being able to tackle and excel at anything I set my mind to.</p>
